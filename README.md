# spotify_bivariate_smoothing
This project contains R code for a seminar on modern regression methods, specifically focusing on bivariate and spatial smoothing techniques. Using R, I first created two datasets, one containing song data from the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), and the other from the [500 Cities project](https://www.cdc.gov/places/about/500-cities-2016-2019/index.html) containing health-related statistics at the city level for the 500 largest cities in the US. I then implemented bivariate smoothing for the Spotify dataset for predicting popularity of songs, and spatial smoothing for the 500 cities dataset to model spatial tendencies for the prevalence of stroke in the city of Atlanta, Georgia.
